__**HARVESTING HIDES FOR TANNING**__
The server has a `!skin` command that has special loot for hundreds of different creature types. This command can be used after hunting or a combat to harvest trophies and other goodies. As an alternative command that feeds into the Leatherworking crafting command, players can instead choose to using the `!tanning harvest` command.

**NOTE** You can only __use one__ of the two commands on something your character has successfully hunted. Either skin it for trophies or harvest it for leatherworking.

If you want to harvest the animal for leatherworking, you can use `!tanning harvest large` or `!tanning harvest small`. Choose the same one that matches the size of the animal you hunted. (i.e. If you started with `!hunt large`, follow up with `!tanning harvest large`)

The command will perform a Sleight of Hand check as your character. If the roll is below the DC check, your character will only obtain a random amount of hide scraps. If your character meets or exceeds the DC, they will get a random amount of hide pieces. Additionally, if they roll a natural 20, they will obtain a small bonus amount of pieces or scraps.

__**TANNING HIDES**__
Leather Workers Tools are required to craft these components which can be purchased at any of the general stores. Crafting items takes time. Each check represents 2 hours of IRL time in which a character will have to be actively working on their craft - although they can be role-played having conversations while crafting. On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

The hide scraps and hide pieces required to produced rawhide and tanned leather are found from animals felled with the `!hunt` command.
