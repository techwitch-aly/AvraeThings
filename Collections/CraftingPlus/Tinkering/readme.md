__**ARTIFICER CRAFTING (TINKERS TOOLS)**__
The appropriate levels in Artificer are required to craft these items. Tinkers Tools are also required to craft these items, which can be purchased at any of the general stores. Crafting items takes time. Each check represents 2 hours of IRL time, in which a character will have to be actively working on their craft - although they can be role-played having conversations while crafting. On success, you mark two hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress is made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

Please note that the Prosthetic Limbs are special recipies that must be acquired via in-character roleplay with another Artificer character that knows the recipies. Feel free to tag in <#1373800089713381376> if you have an Artificer looking to learn to craft these items!

The items necessary to craft different items can be found through multiple sources. Metal ore can be mined in <#1158226879795441684> and smelted into ingots in <#1158226781590007809>.

**__Tinkering Commands__**
**NOTE**: By default the command assumes you are using iron ingots for crafting. See below for how to override this.

* `!tinkering <item>` like `!tinkering homunculus` will start the crafting process
  * If you want to use steel ingots, add `-ingot steel` at the end of this starting command. Like `!tinkering homunculus -ingot steel`
* `!tinkering continue` will continue a multistep (multiple checks) project
* `!tinkering cancel` will cancel a multistep (multiple checks) project, losing the materials in the process
* `!tinkering help` will give a listing of what can be crafted and the required materials.
