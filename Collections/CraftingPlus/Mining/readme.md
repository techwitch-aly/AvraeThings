__**Mining**__

Characters can choose to enter the mine daily, or can prepare for a multi-day expedition by purchasing camping supplies and rations from a general store. Characters will utilize the command `!mining` once in <#1158226879795441684> which will roll the survival check needed to find the different ore available. These checks can be rolled at advantage if another character assists. If a vein is located, the character can use `!mining harvest [ore]` to see if they can successfully mine the vein (at advantage if help is provided). A new Survival check only needs to be rolled when the current vein is successfully mined. Each vein yields 2d4 ore, with a natural 20 granting an additional 1d4. Similarly to fishing, foraging, and hunting, characters can make three attempts to mine each day. If you successfully mine a vein, you can make another survival check on the same day to find a new one (max of three assuming you successfully mine each vein) or you can make three attempts to mine the same vein until it is depleted if you do not initially succeed. 

**The DCs for finding and mining ore veins are as follows:**
*Bronze, Copper, and Tin: DC 12*
*Iron: DC 15*
*Silver and Gold: DC 17*

Once players have accumulated ore, they can smelt them into usable metal at a forge. There is a flat rate charge of 75 gold per day to use the forge and a max of five ore can be smelted per day (with the one check).
