__**Mining**__

Characters can choose to enter the mine daily, or can prepare for a multi-day expedition by purchasing camping supplies and rations from a general store. Characters will utilize the command `!mining` once in <#1158226879795441684> which will roll the survival check needed to find the different ore available. These checks can be rolled at advantage if another character assists. If a vein is located, the character can use `!mining harvest [ore]` to see if they can successfully mine the vein (at advantage if help is provided). A new Survival check only needs to be rolled when the current vein is successfully mined. Each vein yields 2d4 ore, with a natural 20 granting an additional 1d4. Similarly to fishing, foraging, and hunting, characters can make three attempts to mine each day. If you successfully mine a vein, you can make another survival check on the same day to find a new one (max of three assuming you successfully mine each vein) or you can make three attempts to mine the same vein until it is depleted if you do not initially succeed. 

**The DCs for finding and mining ore veins are as follows:**
*Bronze, Copper, and Tin: DC 12*
*Iron: DC 15*
*Silver and Gold: DC 17*

Once players have accumulated ore, they can smelt them into usable metal at a forge. There is a flat rate charge of 75 gold per day to use the forge and a max of five ore can be smelted per day (with the one check). 

**Characters are required to be proficient in smith's tools in order to be able to utilize the forge**

Characters can use `!smelting item` to smelt their ore into ingots. This will roll an intelligence based Smithing Tool's check and will automatically pull the materials from the "Mining" bag and convert them to ingots in the "Forge" bag after. We are working on getting a blacksmithing alias made, but for now, players will use `!tool smith str` to turn ingots into items. Players can make **six checks per day** in **both** smelting and smithing.

Players will get three tries with an ore to successfully smelt it into an ingot, after three fails or a single Nat 1 the ore will be useless and lost. 

Characters can also choose to sell their ore or ingots to Kili as well. Ore and ingots will sell for the following amounts: 
Bronze, Copper, and Tin: 5 silver per five ore **or** 1 gold per five ingots
Iron: 1 gold per five ore **or** 2 gold per five ingots
Steel: 4 gold per five ingots
Silver and Gold: 3 gold per five ore **or** 6 gold per five ingots
