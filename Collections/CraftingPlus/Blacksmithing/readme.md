__**BLACKSMITHING TOOLS**__

**More craftable items will be available in the future.**

Blacksmithing Tools are required to craft these items, which can be purchased at any of the general stores. Crafting items takes time. Each check represents 2 hours of IRL time, in which a character will have to be actively working on their craft - although they can be role-played having conversations while crafting. On success, you mark two hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress is made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

The items necessary to craft different items can be found through multiple sources. Metal ore can be mined in <#1158226879795441684> and smelted into ingots in <#1158226781590007809>. Other items can be procured in the general stores or via other crafters (such as Leatherworkers and Woodcarvers).

**__Blacksmithing Commands__**
**NOTE**: By default the command assumes you are using iron ingots for crafting. See below for how to override this.

* `!blacksmithing <item>` like `!blacksmithing rapier` will start the crafting process
  * If you want to use steel ingots, add `-ingot steel` at the end of this starting command. Like `!blacksmithing rapier -ingot steel`
* `!blacksmithing continue` will continue a multistep (multiple checks) project
* `!blacksmithing cancel` will cancel a multistep (multiple checks) project, losing the materials in the process
* `!blacksmithing help` will give a listing of what can be crafted and the required materials.
