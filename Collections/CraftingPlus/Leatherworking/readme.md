__**LEATHERWORKER'S TOOLS**__

**More craftable Items will be available in the future.**

Leather Workers Tools are required to craft these components which can be purchased at any of the general stores. Crafting items takes time. Each check represents 2 hours of IRL time in which a character will have to be actively working on their craft - although they can be role-played having conversations while crafting. On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

The items necessary to craft different items can be found through multiple sources. Buckles and metal scraps can be sourced from Blacksmiths or from the various general stores. Rawhide and tanned leather can be made by characters proficient with Leatherworkers Tools via the `!tanning` command.
